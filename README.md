  "prompt": "A cinematic, low-angle shot in the style of 1980s sci-fi horror. A terrifying, humanoid villain made of dark, twisted vines and wet flesh is physically stepping out of a massive, glowing red rift that tears across the entire width of a concrete laboratory wall. The room is dark and filled with floating ash and blue spores. In the foreground, with their backs to the camera, two brave teenage girls stand ready to fight, facing the monster. One girl has short buzzed hair, the other has long red hair. On the floor, there are exactly two unconscious security guards lying defeated: one lying near the monster's feet by the wall, and one lying closer to the girls. High contrast, ominous red and blue lighting, hyper-realistic, 8k resolution."

3)create a html page with following UI characteristics:
- background is gradient with red-blue changing from time to time frpm blue to red and vice-versa (the change was horizontally fade-in)
- there is a vertical angelic-white glowing line with smooth edges from top to bottom. The ends of the line were very smooth and fading away with glow
- on the left side of line, there was "Power" written in white colour with a glow and from top of the page, it was 1 finger distance bottom
- on the right side of the line, there was "Connection" written in red colour with same glow and from top of the page, it was 1 finger distance bottom
- on the line,  3 cms from bottom, "Story" was wriitten in blue colour such that the line cuts the word from center and the word "Story" was appearing letter-by-letter and fading away
- font size was INTER-SMALL.
-colors were on the dull-dark side

4)To the previous html page, do these changes:
- Now instead of the center vertical line, a line of oval pebbles (very short in height) and with width 2xheight with 1 finger space between them
- from time to time a red line comes lingering like a snake from top and move towards bottom passing through each pebble in a snake-like fashion
- The previous "Power" text is heading of the text "The beginning of something strange"
- The previous "Connection" text is heading of the text "Bonds formed in darkness"
- Add some cards similarly to the bottom of Power card with heading "Story" and body "The narrative unfolds" and another more bottom "Fracture" with body "The world splits apart"
- Similarly below Connection card: "Reality" with body "Truth becomes uncertain" and heading "Upside down" with body "Nothing will be the same"
-the cards should become visible one by one as we scroll downwards


5)The barrier didn't just break—it shattered like glass.

From the swirling eye of the red wormhole, a multi-limbed nightmare lunged into
the flickering light of the lab.

Eleven stood at the epicenter, her hands thrust forward as she channeled a
blinding sphere of blue kinetic fire to hold the beast at the threshold.

The air hummed with the sound of reality tearing at the seams.

Beside her, Mike knelt, clutching a makeshift power-source to boost the lab's
signal, his face a mask of terror and grit.

Every console sparked and died, leaving them with only one choice: win the fight
here, or let the Upside Down claim the memory of Hawkins forever.

This isn't a battle anymore.
It's a test.
